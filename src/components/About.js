    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an AI/ML Engineer with a passion for building production-grade systems that bridge the gap between 
      biological sciences and computer science. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Biological Sciences 
      with a Minor in Computer Science at Oregon State University, I specialize in GPU-accelerated machine learning, 
      distributed AI systems, and full-stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience spans from engineering GPU-accelerated training pipelines using YOLOv11, PyTorch, and TensorFlow 
      on NVIDIA H100/A100 clusters, to architecting multi-agent distributed AI pipelines on Azure. I've built 
      production-grade platforms with React.js, FastAPI, and cloud services, processing 10,000+ documents and 
      reducing manual review time by 70%.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about creating scalable, reliable systems that leverage cutting-edge AI/ML technologies to 
      solve real-world problems, with expertise in LLM pipelines, RAG systems, multi-agent architectures, and 
      cloud-native development.
